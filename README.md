# My Blog

## What is this Project?

This is a PHP-based blog that I created to post my thoughts and what I am currently learning. It consists of a landing page which contains links to all of my previous posts and a link at the bottom to the page where I make a new post. I wrote some PHP code that requires the correct username and password to be entered to access this page. It is hosted at http://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~zm83483/blog/.

## Directories:

images  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the social media logos, which are included as a footer in every blog post.  
scripts  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the PHP file that contains my login info (which is .gitignored for security reasons) and the script that generate the webpages dynamically and then writes a new link into index.html.  
styles  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the shared stylesheet between all of the pages in my blog.

## Sources:

I got the GitHub logo from [GitHub](https://github.com/logos) and I created the mail and link logos in Adobe Photoshop.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript, 4th Edition by Robin Nixon was a good resource when I was learning PHP.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This webpage helped me understand how multiple file uploads work in PHP.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W3Schools was very helpful when I was checking that my syntax was correct and as a general reference.
